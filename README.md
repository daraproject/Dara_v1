DARA enables users to permanently and immutably store virtually any web content forever, using IPFS and Blockchain technologies.
Welcome to decentralized and censorship-resistant publishing for the 21st century!

DARA is a place to store cherished memories, share and publish original content, and is like a personal Wayback Machine just for you!

Hit the DARA icon after installing the extension and it’ll send the page you're looking at to your Dashboard where you can store, save and share. You’ll be prompted to install the Metamask extension to access your Dashboard.

Publish and archive blogs, socials and web pages all in one place!

DARA makes it simple to permanently and immutably store any web content to the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for FREE and FOREVER, and uses blockchain to build a complete publishing ecosystem and social network (coming soon) empowering creators and consumers.
